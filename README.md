## Description

This repository contains a frontend application that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and square root and generates random numbers. The application requires user authentication and maintains individual user balances for performing operations.

This project requires a backend application to run, which can be found at [arithmetic-backend](https://github.com/vitoraderaldo/arithmetic-backend).
